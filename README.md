# Grey2Blue 🛡️  
### Curiosity → Discipline → Defense  
### The journey from seeing the world in grey to understanding how to protect it in blue.

Grey2Blue is my long-running security lab — a space where curiosity turns into skill, and skill turns into capability.

The name comes from the shift I'm making:
- **Grey** → the phase of exploring, learning, taking things apart  
- **Blue** → the phase of defending, detecting, analyzing, and building real security intuition  

Everything here reflects that progression.  
Each week I add new notes, labs, experiments, and small tools — all connected by the same goal:  
**turning raw curiosity into a solid foundation in cybersecurity and IT.**

This repo holds it all:
- hands-on labs  
- packet captures  
- Windows and Linux investigations  
- threat intel findings  
- scripts I build to automate the boring parts  
- breakdowns of attacks and the signals they leave behind  
- and reflections on what actually “clicked” along the way  

It’s not a polished end product — it’s a living environment.  
A growing record of what I’m learning, what I’m breaking, what I’m defending, and how I’m slowly turning **Grey → Blue**.
