Week 2 Reflection – Sysinternals + Wireshark
1. What I accomplished

This week I analyzed core SOC tools including Process Explorer, Autoruns, TCPView, ProcMon, and Wireshark. I learned how they each provide visibility into different parts of a system: process behavior, startup persistence, network connections, system-level operations, and packet-level network data.

2. What I learned

How to verify process signatures and spot unsigned binaries

How Windows persistence mechanisms work

How network connections look in normal conditions vs suspicious ones

How to filter and interpret ProcMon noise

How to capture and interpret HTTP traffic in Wireshark

How SOC analysts think when triaging alerts

3. What challenged me

ProcMon filtering took practice

Autoruns filtering needed the correct tabs

Understanding normal vs suspicious traffic required careful comparison

4. What I will improve

Develop faster mental baselines for “normal” system behavior

Practice mapping process activity to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

Build repeatable workflows for future labs
